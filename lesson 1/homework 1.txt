Subject: Questions about Our Next English Class and Homework Submission

Hi Julia,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding our upcoming English class and also share my homework with you.

Firstly, for our next class, I have a couple of questions:

Could you please confirm the topics we'll be covering in the upcoming session? I want to make sure I'm prepared
 and have any necessary materials ready.

Will there be any specific assignments or exercises we should focus on ahead of the class?


Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Stsiapan
